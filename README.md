# HTML-Personal Website

This website was my first project as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

The website was made entirely out of HTML and very little inline CSS.

This project is representative of the HTML I learnt in the 'Introduction to HTML' and 'Intermediate HTML' modules in the course. The next module in the course was 'Introduction to CSS'.
