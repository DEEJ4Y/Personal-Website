# Personal Website

[This website](https://davidjosephind.github.io/Personal-Website/) was my first project as part of [The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/).

The website was made entirely out of HTML and very little inline and external CSS.

This project is representative of the HTML I learnt in the 'Introduction to HTML' and 'Intermediate HTML' modules in the course.

The goal of this project was to be able to understand and use HTML to structure websites in the best way possible.

The things I learnt to use during this project are listed below:

- Anatomy of HTML tags
- HTML boilerplate
- Structuring text in HTML
- Lists in HTML
- Image elements in HTML
- HTML anchor tags and links
- Tables in HTML
- Using tables for layout in HTML
- Using utf-8 encoded symbols in websites
- Forms in HTML
- Using github pages to host websites for projects

Below is an image of the home page of the website I created.
